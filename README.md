Testing memory allocation in Java, Python and Go

The tests fill an array of 1 million integer objects 100 times
Go uses a struct for an object

In the end the min, avg and max memory is printed, and execution time.

Go is the leanest. Python is the slowest. Java used most memory, although if memory and garbage collection can be configured to be optimal.

Go is the winner as expected. Just wanted to see how much Java and Python lag behind.
